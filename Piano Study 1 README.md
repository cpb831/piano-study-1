Piano Study 1 README

I used Python and a wealth of imported libraries such as matplotlib and pandas to create graphs, maps with points, chloropleth maps, and perform elementary statistical calculations on a csv file of university piano teachers.  The dataset includes names, gender identities, coordinates of each university, as well as names of schools attended and primary teachers.  There is also a basic webscraper before I decided to pull data manually.
